# Animations-PS160
Animations for PS160 at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University

# OpticsImaging
The animation is hosted here: http://www.fastswf.com/wRHa2bs

This animation allows users to change the object distance (try dragging the lens!) and observe the changes in magnification, inversion, and image formation location (shown via raytracing). 

This is the default case for a lens. The image distance, object distance, focal length, and radius of curvature are all positive for this case.
