# Animations-PS160
Animations for PS160 (Physics II for Scientists & Engineers) with Dr. Jeff Sanders at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. These animations were created by Courtney Thurston to fulfill an independent research Honors Contract through the Honors Program of ERAU-DB.

# OpticsImaging
The animation is hosted here: http://www.fastswf.com/wRHa2bs

This animation allows users to change the object distance (try dragging the lens!) and observe the changes in magnification, inversion, and image formation location (shown via raytracing). 

This is the default case for a lens. The image distance, object distance, focal length, and radius of curvature are all positive for this case.
