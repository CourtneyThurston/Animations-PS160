# Summary
Animations for PS160 (Physics II for Scientists & Engineers) with Dr. Jeff Sanders at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. These animations were created by Courtney Thurston to fulfill an independent research Honors Contract through the Honors Program of ERAU-DB.

# Abstract
Physics is notorious among science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students and non-STEM students alike for the unique challenges it poses. Success in physics requires excellent time management, exercised technical skills, visualization capability and mathematical intuition, and communication skills. Due to the range of capabilities that physics courses require of students, many find themselves struggling to keep up with both the mathematical rigor and conceptual understanding – more often than not, at least one piece is lacking. The goal of this research project was thus to develop interactive animations for students to illustrate some of the most misunderstood concepts within Physics II for Scientists and Engineers.

	Research was conducted throughout the project to examine existing animations from professional organizations and other colleges and universities’ physical sciences departments. The American Association of Physics Teachers and the University of Colorado at Boulder in particular have produced extensive suites of physics animations in the past. However, it was discovered that most of these animations lacked interactive capability – they may illustrate one situation or experiment well, but did not allow students to modify independent variables and discover what occurs as a result. Since learning by exploring questions and conducting experiments to answer them is such a core component of Embry-Riddle’s spirit, emphasis was placed on creating animations that allowed students to change variables.
	
	Of the four animations produced, two allow for such manipulation. Incidentally, both are optics animations. The first allows students to drag the default lens case along the x axis – thus changing object distance – and observe what happens as a result to the image formation location, magnification, size, and inversion. This is a concept that is often hard for students to visualize without such an aid, as it involves the consideration of many interdependent variables. The second animation allows students to change the angle of incidence of a ray entering a polymer; when the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle, the animation depicts two resulting rays: one reflecting within the polymer, and one that escapes the polymer. When the angle of incidence is not greater than the critical angle, total internal reflection occurs.
	
	Meanwhile, the other two animations illustrate a concept that many students find counter-intuitive: the relationship between uniform circular motion and simple harmonic motion, and the relationship between spring motion and simple harmonic motion. The first animation shows light shining horizontally across a spinning disk with a small ball affixed to it. As the circular disk spins, the light traces the simple harmonic motion graph in the background, illustrating the relationship between uniform circular motion and simple harmonic motion. In the second illustration, a spring with a writing utensil oscillates horizontally on paper, tracing the simple harmonic motion graph on the paper as it oscillates. 
	
	Consulted during the project duration were Dr. Jeff Sanders, the University of Toronto’s Flash Animation resources, and the course textbook. Technologies used in the creation of the animations included GIMP, Adobe Animate, Adobe Dreamweaver, GitHub in project documentation and hosting, and FastSWF for embedded hosting.

# Optics Image Formation
The animation is hosted here: http://www.fastswf.com/wRHa2bs

This animation allows users to change the object distance (try dragging the lens!) and observe the changes in magnification, inversion, and image formation location (shown via raytracing). 

This is the default case for a lens. The image distance, object distance, focal length, and radius of curvature are all positive for this case.
